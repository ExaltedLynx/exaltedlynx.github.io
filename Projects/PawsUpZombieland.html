                    Paws Up Zombieland is a 2D tower defense game based on Arknights in which you use up to 5 unique units to defend your base against a horde of incoming zombies.
                    Made with a team of four using Unity in 8 weeks for INIT Build at FIU.

                        The main obstacle the team faced was needing the more experienced members to mentor the teammates with less experience. Teaching them the main tools
                        used, mainly Unity and GitHub, did take up some time to handle any issues that any teammates had as well as being the first time mentoring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Other issues we had to deal with was not having a dedicated artist to make proper assets for the game. For myself, the challenge I had to overcome during this project was needing to wear multiple hats. 
                        Needing to handle different aspects of the project simultaneously had me reconsider which tasks I needed to prioritize and which could be left for a later time or delegated to other members.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        While I'm satisfied with how much of the game was completed within the 8 weeks, Features that would have been implemented with more time 
                        would include an indicator for the path the enemies will take before the next wave starts, as well as a tutorial during the first level.

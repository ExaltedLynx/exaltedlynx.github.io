                    Ransacker is a real time inventory management & dungeon crawling roguelike. This project initially started as my entry for 
                    the 2023 GMTK Game Jam, but I decided to continue working on this to release a fully realized version of the game.

                        InventoryGrid is the base script for all the inventories in the game handling placing/inserting and removing items. The inventory is stored as a 2D array
                        where the x, y positions an item takes up are the indexes of where that item is in the array.

                        InventoryController handles the mouse inputs and logic for picking up and placing items as well as when to highlight hovered items.

                        GridInteract handles setting which inventory the player is currently hovering using a collider.

                        InventoryHighlight handles the item highlighter game object, containing functions to change it's size, position, and visibility

                <p class = "textheader">Obstacles:</p>
                <ul class = "textlist">
                    <li> Implementing multiple mechanics and gameplay systems from scratch was a large undertaking at the start of making this game,
                         which pushed me to learn more about properly designing a codebase and when to use different data structures.
                    </li>
                    <li> Staying within a scope for this project, with this being the first larger game I've made, was something I struggled with at the start
                         where I would keep slightly shifting the goal post foward. I dealt with this by making a list of every feature I believed was necessary
                         for the game to be functional and completing only those features first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding features like procedurally generated maps required implementing a pathfinding algorithm to verify valid maps, and learning how more
                        advanced algorithms like the A* algorithm work and is implemented was one of the more difficult parts of making this game.
                    </li>

                <hr class="divider">
                <p class = "textheader">Takeaways:</p>
                <ul class = "textlist">
                    <li> Planning ahead and creating GDD before tackling a larger game like this would have saved a lot of time and effort spent on lower priority features.</li>
                    
                    <li>Doing QA processes such as unit and regression testing to verify functionality of new code or previously implementing features, could have mitigated
                        some of the time spent fixing issues with the game.
                    </li>
                
                    <li>Designing and implementing this game on my own made me realize the complexity of creating and maintaining large codebases as well as the range of programming skills needed. 
                        Also the importance of having a process for designing new features, how to overcome design problems, and iterate on existing features to make them more fun.
